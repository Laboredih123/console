<br>
- Fixed a few issues with the auto-label system rackmounts use. And also made it easier to label systems in your inventory.<br>
<br>
- If two infared beams crossed and you entered one while standing in the other it would fail to trigger. This also fixes another issue with only one signaler triggering for crossed beams.<br>
<br>
- Certain objects were not able to be dropped due to their density.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug with unequipping underground terminals that would cause various things not to be properly reset.<br>

-- Just equip a computer in your inventory and double-click the rackmount to mount the computer to it.<br>
<br>
- Added the setenv Excode function, for speed-sake. Check the reference.<br>
<br>
- Updated the interface to make use of some new BYOND features. This means you need version 430.1005 of BYOND or higher.<br>

<br>
- Computers now have environment variables, they can be set or obtained using the getenv and setenv commands.<br>
-- setenv \[variable\] \[value\] (When value is empty the variable is removed)<br>
-- getenv \[variable\] (When left empty a list of variables and their values is shown.)<br>
<br>
- Changed the format of the unarc command, it now takes three arguments.<br>
-- unarc \[file\] \[directory\] \[password\]<br>
--- directory is the directory you want to extract the files to using '.' will extract to the current directory.<br>
--- Leaving the last two arguments blank will result in extraction to the current directory.<br>
<br>
- The playback system wasn't handling certain HTML properly due to the change that removed html from output.<br>
<br>
- Added a limited ExCode reference manual to the help system, it's just a quick guide to the excode functions, their use and their format.<br>
-- If you find mistakes, lemme know.<br>
-- I didn't include some functions like list functions, as I want to fiddle with that system a little bit first.<br>
-- Tutorials to include with the official help files are welcome!<br>
<br>
- The same labs that auto-load on world startup now auto-save on world shutdown and about once every hour.<br>
-- Ask me if you want your lab added to or removed from the list.<br>

<b><a onclick="expand('N1.6')">Changes for N1.6</a></b><br>
<div id="changes_N1.6" class="change_hidden">
- Added a few more items to the dispensers.<br>

- Added the 'arc' and 'unarc' computer commands, they allow you to create and extract zip-like archive files.<br>
-- arc \[file\] \[archive_file\] \[password\]<br>
-- unarc \[archive_file\] \[password\]<br>
-- The file being the file you want to add to the archive.<br>
-- The archive_file being the file you want to make an archive.<br>
-- The password being the password to set/use for adding/removing files.<br>
<br>
- Added the ascii function to ExCode, it works exactly like char but backwards.<br>
<br>
- The if function was not handling variable-based == comparisons properly in some cases.<br>
<br>
- Laptops weren't properly removing suffix when unequipped.<br>
<br>
- The /sys/shutdown.sys file is now executed when a computer is shutdown, if it exists. All non-saved systems include the file by default.<br>
<br>

<br>
- Added the md5 function to ExCode.<br>
-- Format: md5;string;variable<br>
-- string is the string/variable you want to hash, variable is the variable the result is dumped to.<br>
<br>
- Redesigned mass disk producers.<br>
-- Equip a disk and double-click the mass disk producer.<br>
-- With nothing equipped double-click the producer again.<br>
-- In the interface that pops up fill out the information and click 'Produce'<br>
-- Tada, you have disks (or in amounts > 10 a box of disks)<br>
-- Amounts over 15 aren't accepted.<br>
-- This means I've placed disk producers in more labs now that they're not so complex.<br>
<br>
- Labeling a laptop no longer names it 'computer -...' (Relabel to see the effects)<br>
<br>
- Laptops were not properly unequipping in various cases.<br>

<div id="changes_N1.5" class="change_hidden">
- Fixed cut segment.<br>
<br>

<br>
- You can now equip laptops.<br>
<br>
- Added a 'ckey' ExCode function. Format is ckey;variable;other_variable<br>

<br>
- Fixed a bug that prevented maximum length underground terminals from being removable.<br>
<br>
- Added speed increases to the ExCode parser and directional antenna signal transfer rate.<br>
<br>
- The console window now better handles the input element.<br>
<br>
- Added mini hubs and routers to various labs, these work exactly like the normal hubs and routers except they're unlockable and can handle about half as many packets at once.<br>
<br>
- You can now unlock antennas, relays, and directional antennas using the wrench, when unlocked you can pick up and move the object. Use the wrench on it again to lock it back in place.<br>
<br>
- Computers now retain their label when being packed up.<br>
<br>
- Expanded the e_key limit to 65,000<br>
<br>
- The saving system was mistakenly saving objects connected to other objects inside of saved areas, this has been remedied by disconnecting any outside connections previous to the save, and restoring them afterwards.<br>
<br>
- Bulletin boards had a malformed removed command which allowed people to select any object within view and effectively summon it.<br>
<br>
- Underground wiring spools are no longer saved with labs.<br>
<br>
- Underground wiring spools were poorly handling running out of wire.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a problem that was causing satellite relays to only send a signal to a very limited range of devices.<br>

<br>
- Lab saving wasn't properly working for multi-area labs.<br>
<br>
- The restart computer command was causing the console window to act up.<br>
<br>
- Lab saving no longer saves various types of items, like paper, keys, locks, etc...<br>
<br>

<br>
- New 4.0 interface, when using a computer the display now appears in a seperate window.<br>
-- If you close the window you can always reshow it using the operate command.<br>
-- You can also 'dock' the window, which will show the computer console above the output area.<br>
<br>
- Basic lab saving is in and has been tested, lab owners now have commands to save and load their labs as they wish. (None of it is automated)

<div id="changes_N1.4" class="change_hidden">
- Copiers no longer copy notoriety stamps.<br>
<br>
- You can now color wire without paint using the color wire command.<br>
<br>
- You can now label wire, any laid wire will be labeled the same as the spool it came from.<br>
<br>
- Signal objects now have a timer to how long they can exist, this timer is reset each time the signal travels, but should prevent signals that end up left-over sitting in hubs/routers after a complex routine.<br>
<br>
- There is now a limit to how many signals things can process at any given time, this should eliminate server crashing wiring loops. <i>I tried some pretty nuts cross-hub wiring crazies and it didn't even make my CPU spike, it was cool looking, but it didn't hurt the system -- huzzah!</i><br>
<br>
- You can now throw away an item in your inventory regardless of type.<br>
<br>

<br>
- shell.scr was not functioning correctly.<br>
<br>
- Changed the changes system, obviously. Added a changes command for quick access.<br>
<br>
- search.exe and scr_compiler.exe weren't working correctly.<br>
<br>
- Added a disk mass-production system to certain labs.<br>
--- Use 'send' to send files to it, each file is added.<br>
--- Use 'extern 0 0 amount \[number\] to change the amount of disks to create.<br>
--- Use 'extern 0 0 0 \[cmd\]' to send commands, 'create' to create your disks, 'clear' to clear the file list.<br>
--- Amounts over 5 will result in a box of disks being created.<br>
--- No amounts over 15 are accepted.<br>
--- 'extern 0 0 label \[text\]' will change the default label of the disks/box.<br>
--- 'extern 0 0 makedir \[dir\]' will make a directory on the machine.<br>
--- 'extern 0 0 cd \[dir\]' will navigate to a directory on the machine.<br>

<b><a onclick="expand('N1.3')">Changes for N1.3</a></b><br>
<div id="changes_N1.3" class="change_hidden">
Added underground wiring terminals, this is basically a way to reduce the amount of clutter and object use.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be made under the make menu and here's how they work: Equip the item, double-click it to start placing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As you move you'll notice the tiles you step on become darker, this indicates that you've placed wire there.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the desired path is reached, simply double click the item again and you'll have what you need.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect wires into both terminals created by the process and sending signal to one will result in it being received at the other, after traveling, of course.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a limit of 50 unique wires between each terminal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may connect both wire and hyperwire to the terminals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to remove these items and wire paths is to cut the terminal with wirecutters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The item will never vanish from your inventory unless you drop it, you should only need one.<br>
<br>
- Made the wiring junction and infared scanner equippable.<br>
<br>
- Paper printed using the printer will now have the file name of what was printed as the paper's label.<br>
<br>
- You could not connect to an infared signaler again after disconnecting it from something.<br>
<br>
- Fixed an issue that caused routers not to respond to various external commands.<br>
<br>
- Shutters are now controlled using boxes like doors are.<br>
<br>
- In some instances cutting hyperwire would cause a regular wire to appear.<br>
<br>
- Various items didn't unequip when another was equipped.<br>
<br>
- Created a lab for Oronar.<br>
<br>
- Added the 'ls' and 'dir' commands, both work indentical to 'display' (dir is no longer used for the secret).<br>
<br>
- You will not set off a signal for infared devices if you move from a turf within the beam to another within the beam.<br>
<br>
- Created a lab for Semereh.<br>
</div>
<hr>
<b><a onclick="expand('N1.2')">Changes for N1.2</a></b><br>
<div id="changes_N1.2" class="change_hidden">
- Added a wiring junction (can be made under the 'make' command tab) this is basically a portable hub, to use it simply drop it and connect wires to it. Each one has four connectors.<br>
<br>
- Window shutters can now be attached to wires, they work much like doors except no control box. The 'toggle' parameter replaces the 'door' parameter and it'll send sqry instead of dqry when accessed.<br>
<br>
- Added a paper scanning device, you can connect this to something and send data from a piece of paper. To scan a piece of paper simply equip it and double click the scanner.<br>
<br>
- Added an infared signaler device, it will emit a beam five tiles long in the direction it is pointed. If anyone passes through the beam a signal will be emitted, either through a connected wire or as a message to everyone in view.<br>

<br>
- Fixed an issue that prevented cut colored wires from properly threaded.<br>
<br>
- Added a lab for Lyndonarmitage1. (Replaced DaveSoft) and a lab for W12W (Replaced the Intercorps Dev area)<br>
<br>
- Fixed the copytext, findtext and replacetext ExCode functions.<br>
<br>
- You no longer have to be standing on the same tile as a microphone or bounce to 'get' it, it can now be done from one tile away as well.<br>
<br>
- Hyperwire's color has been changed so it doesn't match painted wire.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that caused sending files to fail to pass along proper data, causing it to fail in most cases (not all.)<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug in the copy command that caused wildcard copies to fail.<br>
<br>
- Made it impossible for microphones/intercoms to pick up sounds out of computers, and other intercoms/microphones.<br>
<br>
- Added an 'echo_var' command (format: echo_var;variable) that will echo the value of variable to your terminal, makes debugging much easier.<br>
<br>
- Fixed an issue where getfile+eval was no longer appending newlines properly.<br>
<br>
- You can now equip microphones to place them inside of things or on tables.<br>
<br>
- Added 'play.com' to the registry directory, this links to playback.exe for quick sound playing (only affects new computers, not saved laptops)<br>
<br>
- Raised the maximum e_key to 6500.

<b><a onclick="expand('N1.0')">Changes for N1.0</a></b><br>
<div id="changes_N1.0" class="change_hidden">
- FINALLY made it so if you equip something while something else is equipped it won't just unequip the old item it'll equip the new item as well.<br>
<br>
- Added ExCode function 'rand' (format rand;low;high;variable) this allows for easy generation of random numbers.<br>

- Cutting painted wires now leaves pieces of the proper color.<br>
<br>
- Threading wire will now thread wires of the same color only.<br>
<br>
- Added a lab for Derantell<br>
<br>
- Removed the vents, all they do is make getting into labs uninvited easier -- I realize they could be used for wiring, but nobody ever used them for that.<br>
<br>
- Updated the required version to play to a later 4.0 version, this allows me to do a little more with icons and whatnot.<br>
<br>
- Updated directional antenna, you may now send a direction instead of a number using the 'direct' parameter, any direction is valid.<br>
<br>
-- They may also be pointed in diagonal directions now as well, the 'turn' parameter still works as previously.</div>"},"window=changes;size=640x480")
